Variables
Exercise 1: Variable Declaration
1. Declare a variable ‘name’ and assign your name to it.
2. Declare a variable ‘age’ and assign your age to it.
3. Declare a variable ‘isStudent’ and assign it to a boolean value
indicating whether you are a student or not.
4. Print all three variables.
Exercise 2: Variable Reassignment
1. Declare a variable ‘favoriteColour’ and assign your favourite
colour to it.
2. Print the value of favoriteColour.
3. Reassign favouriteColour to a different colour.
4. Print the new value of favouriteColour.
Exercise 3: Arithmetic Operations
1. Declare two variables ‘num1’ and ‘num2’ and assign them
any two numbers.
2. Declare variables to store the sum, difference, product, and
quotient of num1 and num2.
3. Print the results of these arithmetic operations.
Data Typeз s Operatorз
Exercise 1: Numbers
1. Declare a number variable and assign it a value.
2. Declare a number variable and assign it a floating number.
3. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
modulus and exponentiation with number variable and
another number.
4. Print all your variables.
Exercise 2: Boolean and Operators
1. Use comparison operators to compare two numbers and
store the results in boolean variables.
2. Declare two variables x and y with the values 8 and 12
respectively.
Use comparison operators to check and print the following:
• If x is greater than y.
• If x is less than or equal to y.
• If x is equal to y.
• If x is not equal to y.
3. Declare the variables a and b with values true and false,
determine and print the result of the following logical
operations:
• a AND b
• a OR b
• NOT a
4. Declare variable p and assign it a value of 10. Use the
following assignment operators to modify the value of p with
any number and print the result each time:
• +=
• -=
• *=
• /=
• %=
Conditional Statementз s Loopз
Exercise 1: Temperature check
1. Write a code using if else statements to check the
temperature and print a message based on the following
conditions:
• If the temperature is below 0, print "It's freezing!"
• If the temperature is between 0 and 15, print "It's cold."
• If the temperature is between 16 and 25, print "It's mild."
• If the temperature is above 25, print "It's warm."
2. Re-write the code using switch statements.
Exercise 2: Divisibility Check
1. Write a code using if else statements to check if a number is
divisible by 2, 3, or both:
• If the number is divisible both by 2 and 3, print "Divisible
by both."
• If the number is divisible by only 2, print "Divisible by 2."
• If the number is divisible by only 3, print "Divisible by 3."
• If the number is not divisible by either, print "Not
divisible by 2 or 3."
2. Re-write the code using switch statements.
Exercise 3: For loops
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
3. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the
result. Hint: ‘+=’
4. const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Given the array of numbers,
print each element to the console.
5. const numbers = [3, 7, 2, 5, 10, 6]. Given the array of numbers,
find and print the largest number.
#Hint: current value and previous value.
Exercise 4: While loops
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Print all even numbers between 1 and 20.
3. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the
result.
4. Print all multiples of 5 less than 50.
# Hint: ‘%’
Exercise 5: Do While loops
1. Print numbers from 1 to 10.
2. Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 and print the
result.
3. Prompt the user to enter a number greater than 10. Keep
asking until they enter a valid number.
